            Welcome to my portfolio!</p>
          <p>
            Here you'll find a selection of projects
            I've worked on, spanning web development, interactive browser games,
            and small software experiments. Each project showcases not only my
            technical skills, but also my curiosity, creativity, and attention
            to detail.</p>
          </p>

          <p>
            Some projects are academic, some are personal experiments, and a few
            are real-world applications — but all of them reflect my interest in
            building functional, user-friendly, and engaging experiences. I
            enjoy solving problems, exploring new technologies, and finding
            clever ways to make interfaces intuitive and fun.

            the code, or see it in action. I hope you enjoy browsing them as
            much as I enjoyed creating them!

        <section class="introduction">
          <p>
            The projects presented here represent different stages of my
            learning journey as a software engineering student. Some were built
            as part of coursework, while others were created out of personal
            curiosity and a desire to experiment with ideas in a practical way.
            Together, they show how I approach problem-solving, design
            decisions, and implementation.
          </p>

          <p>
            I enjoy working on small, focused projects where I can take an idea
            from concept to completion. This includes planning structure,
            designing simple user interfaces, and refining functionality through
            testing and iteration. Many of these projects started as experiments
            and gradually evolved as I explored better solutions and cleaner
            code.
          </p>

          <p>
            Several of the projects focus on front-end development and
            interactivity, where I work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create
            responsive layouts and engaging user experiences. Others move
            slightly beyond the browser, exploring Java, JavaFX, and basic
            application logic. Even in small projects, I place emphasis on
            readability, structure, and maintainability.
          </p>

          <p>
            I see these projects as building blocks rather than finished
            products. Each one has taught me something new — whether it’s
            working with the DOM, handling user input, structuring a Java
            application, or improving visual layout and responsiveness. I
            continuously revisit older projects to refine them as my skills
            develop.
          </p>

          <p>
            Looking ahead, I am highly motivated to expand my portfolio with
            more advanced projects, particularly within cloud engineering,
            automation, and scalable systems. I am open to collaborating on
            small tasks, prototypes, or experimental solutions for smaller
            companies, startups, or private individuals who need technical help
            or proof-of-concept implementations.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you are interested in collaboration, feedback, or simply want to
            discuss ideas, feel free to reach out. I am always eager to learn,
            contribute, and grow through hands-on experience and real-world
            challenges.
