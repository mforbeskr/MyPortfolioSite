        <p>
          I am 27-year-old and based in Hedehusene, Denmark. I live with my
          lovely partner Alexandra and our 7-month-old son, who keeps everyday
          life both busy and meaningful.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of my studies and work, I enjoy gaming, hygging, and staying
          active. I play video games, enjoy playing basketball, and have a
          strong interest in music — both listening to and creating it in my
          spare time.
        </p>

        <p>
          I value spending time with my family and friends and consider balance
          between professional ambition and personal life an important part of
          long-term success.

          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I have started the Software Engineering Trainee program at VIA
            University College. Alongside my studies, I am seeking a relevant
            trainee position where I can develop my technical skills through
            close collaboration with an organization over an extended period of
            time.
          </p>

          <p>
            I would describe myself as a hands-on and curious IT enthusiast with
            a genuine interest in computer systems, programming, electronics,
            and digital infrastructure. In my free time, I enjoy both gaming and
            programming, with a particular focus on Java and webdevelopment.
            Gaming, sometimes as a leader, has strengthened my analytical
            thinking, teamwork, and problem-solving abilities, while programming
            allows me to explore structured thinking and continuous improvement
            in a practical way.
          </p>

          <p>
            Through my previous professional experience, I have developed strong
            skills in responsibility, communication, and documentation. At
            Roskilde Hospital's Department of Hematology, I worked with data
            registration and documentation in complex IT systems, including
            national healthcare platforms and quality reporting tools.
            Additionally, during my service in the Danish Emergency Management
            Agency, I was entrusted with communication responsibilities, further
            strengthening my ability to convey information clearly and reliably
            in critical situations.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am a fast learner and adapt quickly to new systems and
            technologies. I am fluent in Danish, Norwegian, and English, have
            strong proficiency in Spanish, and a basic understanding of German.
            I enjoy working in English and would welcome an international or
            English-speaking work environment.
          </p>

          <p class="introduction-note">
            On a personal level, I am a dedicated and structured individual who
            values stability, growth, and long-term commitment. I live in
            Hedehusene with my partner and our young son, and I am highly
            motivated to build a meaningful and sustainable career within
            software and cloud engineering. The trainee model at VIA University
            College represents an ideal opportunity for me to combine academic
            learning with hands-on industry experience, creating long-term value
            for both the company and myself.
