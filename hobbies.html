          <h2>Life Outside the Code</h2>

          <p>
            When I'm not studying or working on software projects, I enjoy
            spending my time on activities that keep me both creative and
            grounded. I believe having interests outside of technology is
            important — not only for balance, but also for inspiration and
            long-term motivation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Gaming has been a long-standing hobby of mine and has shaped the way
            I think about problem-solving, strategy, and teamwork. Whether it's
            competitive games or more relaxed experiences, I enjoy the challenge
            of learning systems, adapting quickly, and working towards shared
            goals.
          </p>

          <p>
            I also enjoy programming in my free time, often experimenting with
            ideas that don't necessarily have a strict goal. These small
            projects allow me to explore new concepts, improve my understanding
            of structure and logic, and simply build things for the fun of it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staying active is another important part of my life. I enjoy playing
            basketball and working out, both as a way to stay healthy and to
            clear my head. Physical activity helps me stay focused and energized
            — especially during busy periods of study or work.
          </p>

          <p>
            Music is something I both listen to and create. It's a creative
            outlet that contrasts nicely with the structured nature of
            programming, and it plays a big role in how I relax and recharge.
          </p>

          <p>
            On a more personal level, I value spending time with my family and
            friends. I live with my partner and our young son, who has added a
            new and meaningful dimension to everyday life. Balancing family,
            hobbies, and professional growth is something I care deeply about
            and actively work towards.
